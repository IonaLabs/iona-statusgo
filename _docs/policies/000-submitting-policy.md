# Purpose

Policy Zero establishes the foundational guidelines for
creating, reviewing, and maintaining policies in the `status-go`
GitHub repository. This policy aims to create a collaborative,
inclusive, and transparent process for defining repository
policies, specifically regarding how developers engage with
and contribute to the repository.

# Submitting a Policy Proposal

- Any individual MAY propose a new policy.
- Policy ideas SHOULD be discussed with Core Contributors
(CCs) and other community members.
- All policies MUST be submitted to the `_docs/policies`
 directory as a pull request (PR) within the `status-go` repository.
- All policies MUST be in Markdown format.
- Policy file names MUST follow [File name conventions for ADRs](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record?tab=readme-ov-file#file-name-conventions-for-adrs), e.g. `000-submitting-policy.md`

# Review and Approval Process

The core function of the review and approval process for policy
PRs is to reach consensus on any issue and to reflect the range
of perspectives within the `status-go` community. Policy
submissions must aim to achieve broad community support and
give key stakeholders a chance to gain context of the policy
requirements.

- Policy PRs SHOULD be reviewed by as many Core Contributors (CCs) as possible.
- Any CC MAY review, approve and / or request changes of a policy proposal PR.
- For any policy PR to be eligible for merging, it:
    - MUST address all feedback provided during the review process.
    - MUST be approved by all team leads (of Status Desktop and Mobile).
    - MUST be approved by all members of the @status-im/status-go-guild
     GitHub team.
    - MUST receive a minimum of six approvals from CCs.

# Policy Amendments and Archival

Policies can be amended or archived to ensure they remain relevant and aligned
with community needs.

- Amendments
    - Policies MAY be amended at any time.
    - Amendments MUST be submitted via a PR to the `status-go` repository.
- Archival
    - Policies MAY be archived if they are obsolete or replaced by newer
    policies.
    - Archival MUST be performed by submitting a PR that moves the policy
    to `_docs/policies/archived`.
- The PR MUST include a rationale for the proposed amendment or archival
in the PR description.
- The PR MUST follow the [Review and Approval Process](#review-and-approval-process).
