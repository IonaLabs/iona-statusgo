# Foundational Principles for Policies

**Purpose**: Policies establishes the fundamental rules that govern
the creation, amendment, and enforcement of all actions within the
`status-go` repository. These policies reflect our core values of
inclusivity, transparency, and consensus-driven decision-making while
defining enforceable rules that guide status-go contributions. Policies
are not merely guidelines but are to be respected and adhered to, ensuring
alignment across contributors.

## 1. Inclusivity

Every `status-go` contributor must have an equal opportunity to
participate in the creation and review of policies. Contributions
from all backgrounds and perspectives are encouraged and respected.
The process must ensure:

- **Open participation**: Any individual or group who interacts
with or contributes to the project has the right to voice their
opinions and suggestions.
- **Accessibility**: Policies must be written in clear, accessible
language, and the decision-making process should be easy to understand
for everyone involved.

## 2. Transparency

All discussions, decisions, and processes related to policy creation
must be fully transparent. This includes:

- **Open documentation**: Discussions leading to policy decisions
must be documented and made publicly available. This ensures that
anyone can review the rationale behind a decision.
- **Clear communication**: Changes to policies, including their
rationale, must be clearly communicated to the contributors through
appropriate channels.

## 3. Consensus

Policies must be created and modified through a consensus-based approach,
ensuring that contributors agree on how to move forward. The following
principles should guide consensus building:

- **Collaborative discussion**: Proposals must be discussed openly,
with all points of view considered.
- **Dispute resolution**: If disagreements arise, efforts must be
made to find a compromise that balances the needs of all stakeholders.
- **Final agreement**: Policies should be approved by a clear consensus,
meaning that while not everyone may agree 100%, all should feel their
voices were heard and respected, and the final decision reflects
contributorsâ€™ general will.

## 4. Enforceability and Respect for Policies

- **Key stakeholder approval**: The guild does not have unilateral
enforcement power. Instead, policies require explicit recorded
approval from all key stakeholders before becoming enforceable. This
includes team leads, members of the @status-im/status-go-guild
GitHub team, and other relevant parties.
- **Respect and adherence**: Policies are not optional guidelines.
Once approved, they are enforceable rules that all contributors to
the status-go project are expected to respect. This ensures consistency,
fairness, and alignment with all contributors' shared goals.

By adhering to these foundational principles, status-go policies
create a framework that balances inclusivity, transparency, and
consensus with the need for enforceable and respected policies.
